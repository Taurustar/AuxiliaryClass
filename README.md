# AuxiliaryClass
Auxiliary class that I create for my games in Unity

# What is this about?
The auxiliary class is a C# file that I often use in my projects to facilitate basic and simple functions that can extend functionalities to existing data types in C# and allow me to do useful stuff in Unity. The class is independent and might be used in any context and not only in Unity Projects. (For example, if you have a project with Godot using C#, you should be able to use this as well.)

# So, can I use it?
Of course, it is open to anyone who wants to use it

# What about improvements?
I might be able to make more improvements over time; however, it is not guaranteed. However, if you have a good idea about something that can be included, please feel free to share the improvements.
